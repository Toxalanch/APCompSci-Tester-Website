        <p>Write a program that prints out three lines that state something about today
            (e.g. Today is rainy and cold). You will have to use <i>System.out.println</i>
            three times. You may refer to your HelloWorld.java code, but the goal is that
            you would be able to write a program like this from memory. In fact, I would 
            encourage you to practice throughout the day until you can write a program like
            this without looking back at previous code. When you're feeling confident in your
            ability to (mostly) write this from memory, submit your code on this webpage.
